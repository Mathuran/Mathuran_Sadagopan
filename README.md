## Experience

### Full Stack Developer at Ellis Don Enterprise Intelligence Divions

May 2019 – AUGUST 2018

Created responsive and intuitive web applications using React JS and Vue for the Enterprise Intelligence division of EllisDon. Deployed projects using Docker and Kubernetes and used GCP and Azure to run backend services and pipelines for our application.

## Projects

### [IOT Garden Gnome | 2019](https://github.com/saamirt/IOT-Garden-Gnome)
**Skills used AWS IoT, DynamoDB, C**	   

•	Automated Gardening System built on the NodeMCU, which measures soil moisture, soil and air temperature, and sunlight to determine the best time to water the garden while displaying all the information online

### [Whack-A-Mole AR | 2018](https://github.com/Vithop/Wack-A-Bok) 
**Skils used Unity, C++, C#**

•  Built an interactive game built on Unity using googles’ AR core
•	Players can throw weapons at Moles that pop out of the floor in AR

### [DELTA Hack IV: implemented muscle gesture control user interface | 2018]()
**Skills used C#, Arduino**

•	Using the myo armband’s EMG sensors, 9 axis gyroscope and motion sensors, our team implemented a gesture interface to a 4x4x4 LED cube. Could further be implemented into gesture-controlled robotics.

### [Tesla Coil | 2017]()
•	Built a device that generated an electromagnetic resonance field.
•	Can amplify a voltage to create large sparks of lightning as well as power light bulbs wirelessly
